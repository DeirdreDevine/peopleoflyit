				<p>"Our time in LYIT, I would have to say, was extremely fun. Life-changing in a lot of ways. I thought the college was great; I loved being on campus, I loved the interaction between students and lecturers, loved what we were studying. I couldn't get over the facilities! They have a gym here that we both went to every morning." - Ciaran</p>

				<p>"I was really surprised by the quality of the course as it was the first time it was being done. Some of the lecturers are huge industry professionals. To be guided by these industry giants was amazing. We ended up going into film, but everything we learned in LYIT we apply daily in the editing room with almost every video we make. There's a lot of things we wouldn't be able to do without having studied Animation." <p>- Sean</p></p>

				<p>"LYIT's close proximity allowed me to stay at home while continuing further education. My time there was a lot of fun, I did really enjoy it. I did Business Studies, specialised in Marketing after second and third year and it had a really good community feel to it. Everyone looked out for each other and we made friends for life there. It's very modern, lecture halls, canteen, everything was perfect from my perspective. I found the practical skills from presentations very useful, I have to give presentations to a large group of individuals now in my workplace, the practical elements mixed with the theory really helped." - Martina</p>

				<p>"LYIT had a good array of science subjects, Biological Science which is what I was interested in, and the location is very close to where I lived. I thoroughly enjoyed my time at LYIT, it was very rewarding, I made friends that I'm still friends with today. The lecturers were very good and we were able to interact with them very well. It was so good I nearly didn't want to leave! I'm in environmental science at the moment, and there were a good few subjects I did within my Undergrad which really helped. It helped with general lab skills and I think the independence with the Masters and the research involved sets you up for really doing well going into a workplace." - Bernie</p>

				<p>"I decided to study in LYIT because it was local to where I lived and I had a very strong sense of community in Letterkenny, and because the course of Law that I studied seemed very interesting so I really wanted to get involved as soon as I could. My time there was fantastic, the sense of community really came through. The staff were fantastic, the students were fantastic and I'm really glad I studied there as the classes were smaller so you could get to know the lecturers really well. Now that I'm working at Pramerica in IT, which isn't actually the degree I studied in, the most important skills that I gained at LYIT were interpersonal skills, which are really transferrable to anything that you do." <p>- Paul</p></p>

				<p>"I chose LYIT as a place to study because of the outstanding design modules they had in the courses; product design and digital media. During my time there I returned as a mature student and was treated as one. Everything was in small chunks, laid out properly for us and the lecturers... There was no problem asking them anything you wanted, they were very helpful and encouraging. Currently I do photography exhibitions and graphic design freelance. LYIT trained me in how to be a photographer and a design thinker, and what the design process was." - Patrick</p>

				<p>"I live local, in Killea, just outside Newtowncunningham, so LYIT was the local option for me. It had everything I needed when I went in, I did Marketing in there and they were well known for their marketing studies and their business course, which is why I chose it. It was absolutely brilliant, the course was great and the tutors got you introduced to the college really well. To be honest, when you're a first year, you get your eyes opened to the nightlife too and Letterkenny was a great place for that. But I also learned so much in first year about marketing and business. Because it was local, I was able to keep my local employment in Kernans where I'm still working with. It allowed me to learn on the ground with the retail company I was working with, and I got a lot of hands on experience. In third and fourth year, I was able to branch out into Marketing and bring that into work." - Cathal</p>

				<p>"When I was in 6th year at school, I decided I wanted to do computer game development, so I went to Cavan for two years. I loved the design part in Cavan, but hated the coding, so I ended up giving up on it and decided to pursue graphic design or digital media. I found a course here in LYIT, applied for it, got it and loved it. After 4 years of studying and a year of student union work, I couldn't be happier with my time at LYIT. I come from Dublin where life is very chaotic, but it's very peaceful here. I get to have one-on-ones with my lecturers where that wouldn't be possible in bigger colleges in Dublin. In a lot of ways, LYIT has really prepared me for my future. The presence in the college with students, lecturers, people outside of the course... People would ask me questions, put certain situations to me, and learning to solve those problems have helped me grow as a person and as an academic." - Adam</p>

				<p>"I chose LYIT because I was interested in the courses given and I knew it was a good opportunity for me. I was always very interested in design and I had heard great things about the school. I had a great time at LYIT, I had so much fun learning all the modules, especially graphic design and film. I also had a great time with friends I made along the way. With the teachings, I gained more confidence and understanding of design. It helped me tackle the industry out there, and helped me realise what I wanted to do after I left LYIT, and I have so much confidence with what I am doing now." <p><p>- Gwen</p></p>
